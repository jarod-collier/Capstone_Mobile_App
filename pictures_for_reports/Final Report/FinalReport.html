The app is called Curious Mind and the original idea came from talking with Pastor Marin from St. Johns Lutheran about how difficult it is for people to get in touch with their local pastor. When someone signs up for Curious Mind they have to input whether they are a pastor or a normal user as pastor profiles can add local events for people to go to, create a specialized profile page to show their certifications, and add other verified pastors through a unique security code. To make the app ready for deep, life-altering questions, we have given the user options&mdash;when posting a question&mdash;where they can choose to stay anonymous and if they would like to only allow pastors to comment on the post. Curious Mind also offers a liking feature to show others in the community some of the most top-voted questions. </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Curious Mind has been developed with keeping in mind those who practice Apologetics&mdash;the religious discipline of defending religious doctrines through systematic argumentation and discourse. In the app, we hope to see questions such as: &ldquo;Why would a good God allow evil to exist?&rdquo;, &ldquo;Do all religions ultimately point to the same God?&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Why does God remain so &lsquo;hidden&rsquo;?&rdquo; We envision many users wanting to chime in and add their comments in a way that allows for a sincere dialogue to happen between other users and the pastors. We know that pastors have been trained and already have all of this knowledge in their heads, now we just want to give them the means to share it with the technical world through Curious Mind.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Introduction</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Community members who elect to download Curious Mind will first notice that it is available for both iPhone and Android users. We developed this app using React Native to allow us to write code that would be able to be exported to all mobile platforms. Each phone brand has its differences and when we needed to make sure those platform-specific dependencies worked, React Native allowed for simple if (iOS), else statements to ensure a smooth end-user experience. This idea of crossing over and allowing all platforms to use the app is also how we want the in-app experience to be shaped. Regardless of what Christian denomination the user is&mdash;they do not have to even be Christian&mdash;we encourage everyone to mix on the app and share their viewpoints from their own societal and cultural backgrounds. Within Christianity, you often hear about other denominations having slightly different views than one&rsquo;s own and we want Curious Mind to be the medium in which everyone can come together and see those differences while also highlighting their similarities. To create this atmosphere, we are combining React Native&rsquo;s front-end with Google&rsquo;s Firebase Database functionality to store all of the information that will be used in Curious Mind. Our database will have three tables to store the posts and their comments, the different types of users, and the events that pastors can create to help organize the community. The entire system organization can be visualized in the following diagram (Figure 1).</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c4"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 381.09px; height: 493.50px;"><img alt="" src="images/image2.png" style="width: 381.09px; height: 493.50px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c7">Figure 1: System Overview</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Curious Mind</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Interactable Cards for Questions</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">We aimed to find a happy medium for users to post questions that would be somewhere between a full picture and a comment&mdash;Instagram&mdash;and simply walls of text&mdash;Reddit. After searching through the different React Native packages for displaying content, we decided to go with their Shadow Cards package. The shadow cards are clickable and that allows us to show just a preview of the question on the main feed while the rest of the description and the comments for that question are visible upon clicking the question. The screen in Curious Mind that handles all of the questions is the Main Feed screen and it is shown in Figure 2 with some example questions. Also in Figure 2, the first and the fourth post do not say who they are posted by. This feature will be touched on later, but all questions are allowed to be posted anonymously if the user does not want their name attached to the post. Figure 3 shows an example of a thread screen where other people have commented on the original post. We can that the question was posted anonymously and that it has one like and one report on it as well. These features are used to show the community what questions may be most useful to read and then what questions they maybe should avoid. The original question has a comment made by the user &ldquo;a&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c4"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 223.06px; height: 472.78px;"><img alt="" src="images/image5.png" style="width: 223.06px; height: 472.78px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span><span class="c2">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Figure 2: The Main Feed Screen</span></p><p class="c4 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 302.52px; height: 418.50px;"><img alt="" src="images/image6.png" style="width: 302.52px; height: 418.50px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Figure 3: The Thread Screen</span></p><p class="c4 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Creating a New Post</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">When users have a question to pose to the community, they are welcome to click the second tab at the bottom of Curious Mind to navigate to the &ldquo;Add a New Post&rdquo; screen. This screen, shown in Figure 4, has four inputs that are sent to the database&mdash;the user&rsquo;s question, the question&rsquo;s description, a boolean to determine whether the post should be anonymous, and a boolean to determine whether to allow only pastors to comment. We later check these values stored in the database to determine whether the card on the main feed should display who posted it or whether the thread screen should allow non-pastor users to comment. The &ldquo;Add comment:&rdquo; and green &ldquo;Post&rdquo; button are removed from the thread screen if the user is not allowed to comment, otherwise it looks the same with the different cards. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c4"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 241.93px; height: 491.50px;"><img alt="" src="images/image1.png" style="width: 241.93px; height: 491.50px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Figure 4: Add a New Post Screen</span></p><p class="c4 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Events </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The goal of Curious Mind is to help connect the community to local pastors and other members who want to think deeply about certain aspects of life. In an attempt to achieve that and help people create friendships, we added an Events tab that pastors can use to show when certain get-togethers are happening around their town. We only allow pastors to create events as we do not want the screen filled with all of the clubs or social gatherings that people in the community may be apart of. If someone asks the pastor to post something and the pastor finds it acceptable, then it is allowed for there to be &ldquo;less official&rdquo; events on the screen. The Events Screen can be seen in Figure 5 and notice how there is no button to add an event as the current user signed in is not a pastor. When a pastor is signed in, they are able to access the &ldquo;Add a New Event&rdquo; screen that is shown in Figure 6.</span></p><p class="c4"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 285.23px; height: 577.50px;"><img alt="" src="images/image4.png" style="width: 285.23px; height: 577.50px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Figure 5: Event Screen</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c4"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 269.00px; height: 486.81px;"><img alt="" src="images/image3.png" style="width: 269.00px; height: 486.81px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Figure 6: Adding an event</span></p><p class="c4 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Profile Screen</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The last tab that Curious Mind offers its users is the profile screen. This shows the user different statistics about their activity in the app and also allows them to put a description of themselves for others to see. When a pastor creates an account, their profile has three extra fields&mdash;Preach, Seminary, Pastor Code&mdash;to give other people who look at their account more information about where they preach, where they went to seminary, and the pastor code that is needed to sign up other pastors. This pastor code is randomly generated when a pastor signs up and is used to allow pastors to grow Curious Mind by adding other pastors. We do not want anybody to be able to sign up and have the privileges of a pastor, so we thought that the easiest way to determine if someone else is a pastor is to have the pastors themselves make the decision. The only way to see this code is if the pastor is logged in on their own account. Figure 7 shows an example pastor profile with the security code at the bottom. This code is then used by someone going through the pastor signup process as they would need that code once they reach the screen shown in Figure 8.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c4"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 202.69px; height: 414.62px;"><img alt="" src="images/image7.png" style="width: 202.69px; height: 414.62px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Figure 7: Profile Screen</span></p><p class="c4"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 178.73px; height: 364.50px;"><img alt="" src="images/image9.png" style="width: 178.73px; height: 364.50px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Figure 8: Signing up to be a pastor</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Database Implementation</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Repository Organization and Management</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The main code repository is hosted on a public GitHub repository.

For the front-end code, the main file that handles calling all of the different files will be the App.js file. It then looks into the Screens/ directory to find all of the different screens that the app needs. We have specific Android and iOS directories to keep track of the platform-specific code that we need for Curious Mind. We use the master branch on GitHub to deploy the app while development branches are used to keep track of temporary changes, updates, or in-progress features.

None of us had developed a mobile app so we had to pick a language to write the code in, figure out how to link a database with an app, and learn the requirements it takes to publish an app. </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Choosing a Language</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Determining what language we wanted to write Curious Mind in was a lot harder than we first expected. We spent the first couple of weeks looking into the differences between Xaramin and React Native by creating test projects and following different tutorials. We ended up deciding that React Native&rsquo;s documentation seemed better and it would be easier to implement the kind of app we were going for. Now that we chose to use React Native, we had to figure out how to get Google&rsquo;s Firebase Database to link with our code.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6">Linking the Database</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">We had taken a database class but that did not prepare us for the trials of getting the code to be able to send and receive data with Firebase. Luckily, there were many tutorials online to get Firebase linked with React Native and so we had to take a couple of days to sit down and research all of the different ways we could use these two platforms. Way down the road we also had to do considerable research when it came to having Firebase deal with anything state-related in the app. We ran into errors that were not helpful and it took many hours of researching how to use Firebase and an app&rsquo;s state to find a solution.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Publishing the App</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">One of the areas in our domain that we had to research was how to get Curious Mind to the Apple and Android stores. One example is that we overlooked the difficulty of getting the app to have the same thumbnail for both platforms. We had to play around with the different platform code to get the logo to appear properly. We also had zero ideas about how long it would take to publish the app to the different stores. It was not until later in the process that we found out it would only take 24 hours or so to get accepted. </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Areas of Technical Growth</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jarod </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I have never created a mobile app before so I could argue that everything about this project was an area of technical growth for me. With that being said, one of the largest areas that I grew in was now understanding how apps have to be configured to work properly. I was primarily tasked with the navigation in the app and so I had to figure out how to transfer the screen certain areas when the user clicked on a button or how to clear variables off of a screen when it was no longer in focus. I never thought that each different screen a user navigated between had to be part of a container of all of the same type of navigation. I now look at apps differently and have so much more respect for the layout and setup of certain apps that appear very flashy and smooth. </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">While learning how to connect the backend of the app with the front end, I also grew my abilities to read API and figure out how to apply different functions to code without seeing a close example on a website like StackOverflow. I also had my first experience finding large amounts of outdated code on the internet and so I became very dependent on documentation and I now feel confident to write almost any program as long as there is good documentation.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I wrote or created most of the sprint reports, presentations, and the poster so I believe my technical writing skills have strengthened during the course of this semester.

Review the work of others in an objective, candid, and properly-documented way.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Whenever we wanted to make commit code to development we would either do a merge request or the person who wrote their code would share their screen on discord and we would go through the changes together to make sure everyone is happy with them.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">PRINCIPLE 8: SELF </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">8.01. Further their knowledge of developments in the analysis, specification, design, development, maintenance, and testing of software and related documents, together with the management of the development process.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ensuring that we had a good development process was huge so that we would not run over anyone&rsquo;s code. Every time we had a new feature we would make a new branch on GitHub and whenever we wanted to merge our branch we would follow these steps: pull development, merge development into our just finished branch, fix any possible merge conflicts, commit and push our branch so that there is a trace of the pre-merged code, merge our branch into development, and then push development.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Teamwork Reflection</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">We met at least once&mdash;virtually over discord or at Mazen&rsquo;s house&mdash;each sprint to ensure that we are all on the same page and would know what work there was to be done. We also tried to stay in relatively frequent communication either through an SMS group chat on our phones or on a discord server that Jarod made for the class. In terms of work, we wanted to make sure that what was assigned every two weeks to a person would be reasonable considering their past willingness to complete issues as well as their skillset. Jarod focused mainly on connecting the database with the front end as he likes to be the man in the middle and read API to figure out how different packages, hooks, and data structures work. Mazen initially started out largely on the front-end and designed much of what the basic backbone of the app looks like and then he shifted over to help Brendan with the database and data transfer. Brendan had taken a web application class and had used Firebase and so we assigned him to figure out how to get information to Firebase and then how to use the information already there for whatever the app needs, such as resetting a user&rsquo;s password. Therefore, with all of us sticking to these ideals, we were able to create a successful capstone project. By staying organized on GitHub and keeping up with our communication, we believe our teamwork has helped to make Curious Mind the best app it could be.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Conclusion</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Throughout this semester, our team was able to create an app from scratch that will be immediately used in the community. Using React Native and Google&rsquo;s Firebase database, we are able to provide people in the community a means to connect with local pastors and ask them their opinions on some of the tougher topics that Christians face. We also hope to have had enough foresight that allows users who are not Christian&mdash;or simply those who want to keep their identity hidden&mdash;a way to use Curious Mind anonymously. Users are able to rest assured knowing that only people other pastors deem as &ldquo;knowledgeable&rdquo; are able to have special privileges on the app so that the community can stay as toxic-free as possible. This project is well passed the &ldquo;proof of concept&rdquo; point and is ready to be a full-blown app that users can download from their phone&rsquo;s app store.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Major Challenges Faced</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Throughout the course of development for Curious Mind, our team definitely ran into some major challenges. One of the more prominent challenges was not being able to test code ourselves for both iOS and Android. Mazen was the only one who could work on the iOS side of things while Jarod and Brendan had to work primarily on Android due to their computer and personal cellphone setup. It took us some time to get the styling to look right across the systems as some available options in React Native&rsquo;s styling package would not show up on one platform but would on the other.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">One of the other biggest issues we ran into was controlling the state of the app and updating it without a deliberate pull down of one of the screens. We needed to create classes in order for React Native to sense that the app&rsquo;s state changed but that caused major issues with navigation. React Native has a very extensive React Navigation doc that we used to move screens within the app, but every example was just using functions. We were able to avoid having to switch to classes until the end of the project when we could not update the value of the likes a question had without pulling down the screen to refresh it. It took Mazen and Jarod close to 30 hours to get everything to work back to normal once they started switching the project structure over to classes. </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Even after dealing with each of these major complications, our estimations each development sprint were pretty accurate. When we ran into a problem that we did not prepare for in the sprint, we simply added another GitHub issue and estimated how long it would take and then continued working. By putting in the time to make sure we understood an issue and how we should attack it to complete it, we were never too overwhelmed and were able to finish most of our issues each sprint.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Future Work</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Although Curious Mind does function as was intended, there is always room for more features. There is a decent chance some of us still work on this app and features we would like to add are having Google Translate integrated into the cards, Google Maps integrated into the events screen, and anything to improve the UI of Curious Mind. We also would consider allowing users to directly message each other on the app if we found plenty of free time to work on it. </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Keys to Success </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">We firmly believe that the curriculum at Grand Valley helped us to prepare for this capstone and really allowed us to excel. At the beginning of the semester, this capstone course focused on GitHub Management, an Agile workflow, and bi-weekly sprint reports. Luckily, many of the courses at Grand Valley already prepared us for this work by exposing us to Git and the Agile framework and then assigning different computer science projects that would be due in two weeks to get us used to that time frame. To achieve success in capstone, groups have to be diligent and committed to doing work each week and not wait until the due date to get started. So often in long term projects, certain sub-checkpoints require other sub-checkpoints to be finished and if one person in the group waits to finish their work, it can put everyone behind. Be thoughtful of other people&rsquo;s workload but also make sure you are willing to sacrifice your time to give your team the best possible chances at success.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p></body></html>
